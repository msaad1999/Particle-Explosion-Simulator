# Particle Explosion Simulator
#### msaad1999

#### A C++ Based Particle Explosion-Effect Simulation

## OVERVIEW

This Simulation was coded in C++, using the SDL2 - 2.0.8. No custom images are used, all particles are hard-coded pixels with constantly changing RGB values, resulting in the overall color changing hues very smoothly. 

The overall motion of the particles is that of a Repetitive-Explosion, in which the particles explode and implode continuously, with straggler particles re spawning in the center with randomized spiral paths, resulting in a mixed sort of patter. The Box Blur effect was used to create smooth particle trails.
